# 🛡️ FraudShield: Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Built using Python and scikit-learn, the model is trained on a real-world dataset and aims to distinguish legitimate transactions from fraudulent ones.

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Objective**: Identify fraudulent credit card transactions using supervised learning.
- **Dataset**: (Available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)).
- **Key Challenge**: Handling highly imbalanced data with very few fraud cases.

## 🧠 Skills & Concepts Learned

- Data preprocessing and feature scaling with **Pandas** and **NumPy**
- Handling class imbalance using **undersampling**
- Model training using **Logistic Regression**
- Evaluation using **precision**, **recall**, **F1-score**, and **confusion matrix**
- Visualizations with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
- Working with **Jupyter Notebooks** for end-to-end data analysis

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook


## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit_card_fraud_detection.git

2. Install dependencies

Use pip command

3. Open the notebook

jupyter notebook credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb

✅ Results
The Logistic Regression model achieved high precision and recall on fraudulent transactions by properly balancing the dataset and tuning the model on relevant features.
